## Design
### Colour Scheme
- A dark background has been used to help accentuate the acid green used across the site. Al over text is in white to also stand out against the dark background.
### Typography
- 'Russo One' was used as the primary font across the website due to its blocky form which assists with readability and matches the desired punk style of the website.
### Images
- I chose particulary colourful images for the gallery section to bring attention to the images and highlight the work that the artists have carried out.

### Live Testing
I carried out life testing after the website had been deployed to GitHub pages using the following devices & browsers;
- Desktop computer
	- Using Google Chrome
- IPhone XR
	- Safari
	- Google Chrome
	
I also asked 2 of my friends to take a look and see I they could see any issues using their devices and browsers. Between them they also tested on the following additional platforms;
- Desktop computer
	- Opera
- Apple IPad
	- Safari
### Known Bugs
1. When being viewed on and Apple via Safari, the hamburger drop down menu only operates using a force touch rather than just a tap. With more knowledge in the future i would come back and fix this issue using JavaScript. 
2. Also while using Safari on a mobile device the contact phone number located on the contact page becomes a clickable link. This is not represented in the code and I believe this is a Safari function when presented with a phone number.
3. While using Google Chrome on a mobile device the contact email address located on the contact page becomes a clickable link. This is not represented in the code and I believe this is a Chrome function when presented with an email address.

### Code Credits

Creating the carousel on the index page would not have been possible without the use of online tutorials and code libraries.

The code itself was modified to fit my needs but the original code was found on codepen.io - written by Andrew Chaika (andrewchaika).
